# Flower Shop Delivery App Project

This package contains a complete set of deliverables for the Flower Shop Delivery App concept, nicknamed "BloomNow". 

## Project Overview

BloomNow is a simple, elegant web application designed for users to browse, select, and order floral arrangements for delivery. The focus is on a clean user interface and a streamlined checkout process.

## How to Navigate This Package

Start with the `index.html` file in the root directory. This hub page provides easy navigation to all project components.

### Components

1.  **Documentation (`/docs`)**
    - Contains all project documentation, including an overview of the application's goals, functional/non-functional requirements, and detailed user flows.

2.  **Wireframes (`/wireframes`)**
    - Low-fidelity, grayscale HTML mockups of the application's key screens. These focus on layout, structure, and user flow rather than visual design.

3.  **Interactive Prototype (`/prototype`)**
    - A high-fidelity, clickable prototype built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is mobile-friendly and powered by mock data to simulate the real user experience.

Each component is self-contained and linked from the main `index.html` hub.
